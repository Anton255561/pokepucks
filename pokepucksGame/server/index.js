                 * This is the code for the game side of PokePucks. 
                 * The classes create the player, Pucks, slammers, and the game between code lines 328 and 369.
                 * The Game has three stages. Setup, Loop, and End.
                 * Setup is where the players are decided, special rules are decided, health stacks are built, the arena is built, and the slammers are picked,between code lines 371 and 442.
                 * Loop is where the game is played. 
                 * Loop has 6 phases. Top off, Knockout, Count Attacks, Make Attacks, Discard Pucks, and Check for Winner.
                 * Top off is where the arena is filled with pucks from the player's health stacks, in code lines 444 to 490
                 * Knockout is where the player's slammers are placed in the center if they have no pucks in their health stacks, in code lines 492 to 507.
                 * Count Attacks is where the players get the minimum of 1 attack in code lines 509 to 518.
                 * Make Attacks is where the players make their attacks and flip pucks in the arena, in code lines 520 to 617.
                 * Discard Pucks is where the players can use pucks and remove them from the arena and place them in the discard pile, in code lines 619 to 631.
                 * Check for Winner is where the game checks if a player has won, in code lines 633 to 654.
                 * End is where the game ends and the winner is displayed.in code lines 656 to 673.
                 * 
                 * 
                 * Future Plans:
                 * -Have a unique way of allowing the players to throw their slammers at the stack of pucks.
                 * -Have special abilities for slammers.
                 * -Have special abilities for pucks.
                 * -Show the custom pogs in canvas.
                 * -Have more than two players play the game
                 * -Optimize the code
                 * -Make the game more visually appealing
                 * -Add more features to the game
